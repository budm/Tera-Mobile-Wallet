# Tera-Mobile-Wallet
Tera Android Mobile Wallet developed by Budm/Budmarv2 on Kodular

Tera Mobile Wallet was developed as easy way to be a middle man between a web wallet, and a mobile wallet, its a glorified wrapper built around the web wallet, with a few other things added.


*To Continue Development, Load the AIA File into Kodular. 
None of the Code is Commented, as this AIA file was only released as a formality, nothing was intended for other peoples eyes. But most folks in this community will want the source so they can tweak it.

Version 1.0:

*Basic Web Wallet Access
*QR Code Generator
*Store Keys in .Txt File on Phone

It is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 to allow for further development if anyone else feels the desire to, granted the platform is limited in its abilities. Would also make a great base for other crypto web wallets.
