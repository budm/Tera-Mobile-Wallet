How to contribute to Tera Mobile Wallet
Did you find a bug?
Open up a GitHub issue if the bug is something to do with the user interface, of the application itself. 
If the issue is with the wallet aspect that is best handled by contacting the Tera Foundation.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.

Before submitting, please read the Contributing to Tera Mobile Wallet completely.

Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Tera Mobile Wallet will generally be accepted, in time, granted it may be quicker to release your changes as a seperate fork.

Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
Submit a Pull Request and we can discuss implementing it.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

Do you have questions about the source code?
Do you want to contribute to the documentation?
This wallet was a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and make the wallet your own!

Thanks! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
